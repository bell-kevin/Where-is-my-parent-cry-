Mothers arranged a dance party for the children in school. At that party, there are only mothers and their children. All are having great fun on the dance floor when suddenly all the lights went out. It's a dark night and no one can see each other. But you were flying nearby and you can see in the dark and have ability to teleport people anywhere you want.  Legend: -Uppercase letters stands for mothers, lowercase stand for their children, i.e. "A" mother's children are "aaaa". -Function input: String contains only letters, uppercase letters are unique. Task: Place all people in alphabetical order where Mothers are followed by their children, i.e. "aAbaBb" => "AaaBbb".


== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project.  We have an
[open {bug ticket, mailing list thread, etc.} ](INSERT_LINK) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
[check this resource](INSERT_LINK) for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
